## Usage

This app has multiple game modes:
- Description guess: guessing a hero based on their hero description
- Ability guess: guessing a hero based on one of their abilities
- Image guess: guessing a hero based on a cropped section of their splash art
- Stats/Hero guess: guessing a hero based on stats of the hero

This app allows users to keep track of their data by creating an account

The features of creating an account include:
- A different header with different links
- The ability to view your profile, change profile picture, change username, email, or password
- the ability to view your game stats such as number of wins, losses, winrate
- The ability to be placed on the leaderboard to compete with other players based on the number of wins
- The ability to view your entire match history with the attempts, gamemode, and date

Users who do not have an account are still able to play, however their data will not be saved and they have fewer access to all of the website's features.

User data is stored using supabase and react query for fast data retrieval.
